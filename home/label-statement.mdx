title: "Horizontal, anti-capitalist, anarchist behaviours beginning as an agile electronic music label"
---

We reject hierarchical structures, embracing rotatable roles and challenging traditional fixed artist-label relationships. We do not align with the profit-motive nor believe in a society that does so. We cultivate a practice of voluntary, iterative and decentralised creativity around common interests such as repetitive, reductive, rhythmic and objectively good electronic music.
